# OpenAI API Quota Issue - Resolution Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue: API Quota Exceeded**

You're seeing this error:
```
Error code: 429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

This means your OpenAI API key has reached its usage limit.

## 🔧 **How to Fix This**

### **Step 1: Check Your OpenAI Account**

1. **Go to OpenAI Platform**: https://platform.openai.com/
2. **Log in** with your account
3. **Check Usage**: Go to "Usage" section to see current usage
4. **Check Billing**: Go to "Billing" section to see your plan

### **Step 2: Understand Your Plan**

**Free Tier ($5 credit):**
- Limited monthly usage
- Resets monthly
- May have been exhausted

**Pay-as-you-go:**
- Need to add payment method
- Pay per token used
- No monthly limits (just billing limits)

### **Step 3: Solutions**

#### **Option A: Add Payment Method (Recommended)**
1. Go to **Billing** section
2. Click **"Add payment method"**
3. Add credit card details
4. Set usage limits if desired
5. Your API will work immediately

#### **Option B: Purchase Credits**
1. In **Billing** section
2. Click **"Add credits"**
3. Purchase additional credits ($5, $10, $20, etc.)
4. Credits are applied immediately

#### **Option C: Wait for Reset (Free Tier Only)**
- Free tier resets monthly
- Check when your quota resets
- Limited to $5/month usage

#### **Option D: Create New Account**
- Create new OpenAI account
- Get new API key
- Update your .env file
- **Note**: This may violate OpenAI terms if done repeatedly

## 🛡️ **Improved Chatbot Features**

I've updated your chatbot to handle quota issues better:

### **Smart Fallback System:**
- **First**: Tries to answer from knowledge base (97 mental health Q&As)
- **Second**: Only uses OpenAI API if no good knowledge base match
- **Third**: Shows helpful error message if API fails

### **Reduced API Usage:**
- Prioritizes knowledge base responses
- Reduced max_tokens from 200 to 150
- Better error handling

### **User-Friendly Errors:**
- Clear explanation of quota issues
- Direct links to fix the problem
- Fallback to knowledge base when possible

## 🧠 **Knowledge Base Fallback**

Your chatbot now works even without API access by using:
- **97 mental health Q&A pairs** from your dataset
- **Direct matching** for common mental health topics
- **Professional guidance** and crisis resources

## 💡 **Cost Management Tips**

### **Reduce API Costs:**
1. **Use knowledge base first** (already implemented)
2. **Shorter responses** (max_tokens reduced)
3. **Cache common responses** (could be added)
4. **Set usage alerts** in OpenAI dashboard

### **Monitor Usage:**
- Check OpenAI dashboard regularly
- Set up billing alerts
- Monitor token usage

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Immediate (5 minutes):**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method
3. Your chatbot will work immediately

### **Alternative (No cost):**
1. Use the knowledge base fallback
2. Test with mental health topics like:
   - "I feel anxious"
   - "What is depression?"
   - "How to manage stress?"

## 🧪 **Test Your Fix**

After adding billing/credits:

1. **Restart your Streamlit app**
2. **Try a simple question**: "How are you?"
3. **Check if API works** or if it uses knowledge base
4. **Monitor the sidebar** for system status

## 📊 **Current Chatbot Status**

**✅ Working Features (No API needed):**
- Knowledge base responses (97 Q&As)
- Crisis detection and resources
- Voice input (if PyAudio working)
- Professional guidance
- User interface

**⚠️ Limited Features (API needed):**
- Custom AI responses
- Complex conversation handling
- Personalized responses beyond knowledge base

## 🎯 **Recommended Action**

**Best Solution**: Add a payment method to your OpenAI account
- **Cost**: Very low (few cents per conversation)
- **Benefit**: Full AI functionality
- **Time**: 5 minutes to set up

Your chatbot is still functional with the knowledge base, but adding billing will unlock the full AI capabilities!
