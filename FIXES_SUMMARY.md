# Mental Health Chatbot - Issues Fixed

## 🔧 Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Security Issues - FIXED**
- **Problem**: OpenAI API key was hardcoded in source code
- **Solution**: 
  - Created secure configuration system using environment variables
  - Added `.env.example` template file
  - Updated all code to use `python-dotenv` for secure key management

### 2. ✅ **Deprecated API Usage - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Using old `openai.Completion.create()` with deprecated "davinci" engine
- **Solution**:

  - Switched to `gpt-3.5-turbo` model
  - Implemented proper message structure with system/user roles

### 3. ✅ **Missing Dependencies - FIXED**

- **Solution**:
  - Updated `requirements.txt` with correct package names and versions
  - Installed all required packages

  - Improved error handling and user feedback
  - Added timeout and noise adjustment features
  - Made voice input optional with graceful fallbacks

### 6. ✅ **Data Integration - FIXED**
- **Problem**: CSV data was loaded but never used
- **Solution**:
  - Integrated mental health dataset into response generation
  - Added keyword matching for relevant context
  - Created knowledge base search functionality
